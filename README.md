# ApiAuth

Basic template for an [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) api with [Pow](https://github.com/pow-auth/pow) for authentication

To start your Phoenix server run `./Taskfile`. There are other functions avaliable to run in the `Taskfile`that can be listed with `./Taskfile help`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Also, executing the script `./rename_phoenix_project.sh` will rename the modules as well the OTP app. In order to do that, you need to replace the variables `NEW_NAME` and `NEW_OTP` with the appropriate new names (script taken from [here](https://www.abhinav.co/rename-elixir-phoenix-project))
